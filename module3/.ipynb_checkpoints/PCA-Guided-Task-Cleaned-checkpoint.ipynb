    "## Pricipal Coordinate Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "At times, when you're working with complex data, you have so many variables that you're not sure where to start...It's in these cases, when you have many variables to consider that I often turn to PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these situations of variable-overload, I often struggle to understand the relationships between each variable.  Am I overfitting a model -- its hard to tell with so many variables?  I'm also often concerned that I may be violating assumptions of a model, especially that featurse are independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "PCA helps to reduce the dimension of your feature space. By reducing the dimension of your feature space, you have fewer relationships between variables to consider and you are less likely to overfit your model. (Note: This doesn’t immediately mean that overfitting, etc. are no longer concerns!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing the dimension of the feature space is called more officially “dimensionality reduction.” There are many ways to achieve dimensionality reduction, but most of these techniques fall into one of two classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature Elimination\n",
    "* Feature Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature elimination is what it sounds like: we reduce the feature space by eliminating features.  Instead of considering all 100 features, we'll only use 10. Advantages of feature elimination methods include simplicity and maintaining interpretability of your variables. As a disadvantage, though, you gain no information from those variables you’ve dropped (and they may be important!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction, however, doesn’t run into this problem. Say we have ten independent variables. In feature extraction, we create ten “new” independent variables, where each “new” independent variable is a combination of each of the ten “old” independent variables. However, we create these new independent variables in a specific way and order these new variables by how well they predict our dependent variable.  In the Statquest video, these were the fitted eigenvectors he discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis is a technique for feature extraction — so it combines our input variables in a specific way, then we can drop the “least important” variables while still retaining the most valuable parts of all of the variables! As an added benefit, each of the “new” variables after PCA are all independent of one another. This is a benefit because the assumptions of a linear model require our independent variables to be independent of one another. If we decide to fit a linear regression model with these “new” variables, this assumption will necessarily be satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When should PCA be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do you want to reduce the number of variables, but aren’t able to identify variables to completely remove from consideration?\n",
    "* Do you want to ensure your variables are independent of one another?\n",
    "* Are you comfortable making your independent variables less interpretable?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you answered “yes” to all three questions, then PCA is a good method to use. If you answered “no” to question 3, you should not use PCA.\n",

    "\n",
    "For each image, ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)\n",

Standardization involves rescaling the features such that they have the properties of a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n",
    "\n",
    "While many algorithms (such as SVM, K-nearest neighbors, and logistic regression) require features to be normalized.  Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a prime example of when normalization is also important. \n",
    "\n",
    "In PCA we are interested in the components that maximize the variance. If one component (e.g. human height) varies less than another (e.g. weight) because of their respective scales (meters vs. kilos), PCA might determine that the direction of maximal variance more closely corresponds with the ‘weight’ axis, if those features are not scaled. As a change in height of one meter can be considered much more important than the change in weight of one kilogram, this is clearly incorrect.\n",
